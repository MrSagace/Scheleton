# Scheleton

 You are a scheleton throwing bones at the slimes that are trying to eat your body. You can also destroy the slimes by jumping on their head. The game becomes harder and harder as you progress. Slimes can drop extra lifes if you are in need.

# Controls:
A - Move Left
D - Move Right
SPACE - Jump
LEFT CLICK - Throw bones; The direction of the bone thrown is based of the character's position in relation to the mouse position.

This is my first game and it was made in Pygame, still in Aplha stage.
You can find a playable downloadable zip in "/build" folder. I'm opened to suggestions. Enjoy! :)
